Projects can be saved and inside a project, a user can save multiple palettes. A user can view their saved palettes for any specific project. By selecting a saved palette, they can view the colors on the flowers.

This project has a postgres database for storing project and palette information. The server is built with Express.js, while the front end was build with jQuery.
